# JATAYU 🦅	

Jatayu is a command line interface (CLI) tool which helps to generate READY-MADE React projects for the App (web-app) or Library (common components) development. 🚀	

## What is the purpose of JATAYU ? 💁

Did you ever tried setting up your own `react` environment without `create-react-app` ? Then you know the pain behind it. Adding testing support or webpack or typescript will just increases that pain. 😪	

`JATAYU` is that pain killer 💊. If you want to have custom setup for your react web app or component library without the need of CRA or it's alternatives, `JATAYU` to the rescue. 🥳	

We provide you the skeleton structure and sky is the limit for it's tuning.

At its very core `JATAYU` offers four kind of `ready-made` react projects for the end users.

```
  1.WAJS - Web App with JavaScript support
  2.WATS - Web App with Typescript support
  3.CLJS - Component Library with JavaScript support
  4.CLTS - Component Library with Typescript support
```

When you choose any one of the above projects, we provide you the ready-made skeleton structure.

So what do we mean by that? 🕶️

You will get below items in your ready-made projects for WebApp react projects

- `config` folder with all the `webpack` supplements (dev & prod) 🌱	
- `public` folder with root index.html 🌴
- `src` folder with some inbuilt react components with `routing` 🌲	
- inbuilt `scss`, `react-testing-library` 🍁	
- some default `lint` rules 🌵	

For Component Library projects you will get below items out of the box

- A custom `webpack` setup 🌱
- Custom testing setup with `react-testing-library` 🌲
- Isolated components testing with `storybook` 🍃

```
You can always override the default items provided, you can tune them , refine them into your needs. 🧰
```
